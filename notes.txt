for restaurant recommendation system we will build content-based recommendation system using cosine similarity.

two main types of recommendation systems

1) content-based filtering - it is based on features such as cuisine,price,location etc.

                            A Content-Based Recommendation System recommends restaurants similar in content (features) to the one the user likes.


2) collaborative filtering - it is based on reviews,ratings
                             - Collaborative Filtering (CF) means “recommending items based on what similar users liked.”

                              In short:

                               “People who are like you, liked these items — so you might like them too.”

                               “Hey Vishwa, since people similar to you liked Truffles, you might like it too!” ✅

That’s Collaborative Filtering.
